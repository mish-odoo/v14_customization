1) The system will not display all products that are available for eCommerce, it should display one item for each identity group for example:
    a. Assume we have 3 products:
        i. Product A: identity group X
        ii. Product B: identity group X
        iii. Product C: identity group X

The system will display only one product with the eCommerce name that we defined in the product.

2) The ecommerce will show the following attributes beside the product:
    a. Size: (List of available Sizes will be the values from the products under the same identity group) and the on-hand Qty per size
    b. Color: (List of available color will be the values from the products under the same identity group) and the on-hand Qty per color

3) The images and price displayed will be the images for product of the selected size and color.

4) Once the user chooses to buy the product the id will be for the product with the same identity group, color and size.
